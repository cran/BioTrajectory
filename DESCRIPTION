Description: Tools to process the information obtained from experiments conducted in the Barnes Maze. These tools enable the detection of trajectories generated by subjects during trials, as well as the acquisition of precise coordinates and relevant statistical data regarding the results. Through this approach, it aims to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of observed behaviors, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of learning and memory processes in such experiments.
