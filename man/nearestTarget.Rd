\title{Finds the nearest targets to a set of points within a specified radius.}
\usage{
nearestTarget(points, targets, r)
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{A matrix or data frame containing the coordinates of the points with 
rows representing points.}

\item{targets}{A matrix or data frame containing the coordinates of the target locations 
with rows representing targets.}

\item{r}{A numeric value specifying the radius within which to consider targets.}
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns:
\item{nt}{Index of the nearest target for each point. If no target is found within the 
  radius, this will be -1.}
\item{d}{Distance to the nearest target. If no target is found within the radius, this 
  will be -1.}
}
\description{
Calculates the distances between a set of points and target locations. 
It identifies the nearest target for each point and checks if the distance is within 
a specified radius. If a target is found within the radius, its index and distance 
are returned; otherwise, -1 is returned for both.
}
\examples{
# Define a set of points and targets
points <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), ncol = 2)
targets <- matrix(c(2, 3, 5, 6), ncol = 2)
radius <- 2

# Find the nearest targets
nearest_results <- nearestTarget(points, targets, radius)

# Print the results
print(nearest_results)
}
